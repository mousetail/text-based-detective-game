-------------------------

In regards to your questions:

Your father's Company "Red's Bikes" was valued at 造1,542,000 during the december audit. You may object
to this valuation, but I doubt it will change much. When an asset is left to multiple beneficiaries, you
have the following options:

1. Each beneficiary pays 造1,542 in inheritance taxes, and gain joint ownership of Red's bikes. There
may be more costs involved in changing the registration status of the company, creating a co-ownership
contract, and other related fees.

2. One or more beneficiaries can buy out each others shares. Since there are two in this case, either one
of you could pay 造771,000 to the other plus 造3,084 in inheritance takes, and take complete control
over the company. Note if you agree to pay a different amount you may need to pay additional gift tax
on the difference.

3. If neither party wants to buy out the shares and the parties are unable to come to another agreement,
the company will be sold on the public market, overseen by the executor (which is me). The proceeds, minus
inheritance tax and other fees, will be divided over the beneficiaries. 

You have until 31-1-2024 to reach an agreement.

Let me know if you have any more questions.
