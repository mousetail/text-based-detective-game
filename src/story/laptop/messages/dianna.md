I didn't catch you after the presentation but I think you did great!

Who was the guy in the suit you where talking to in the end?

:::

::: sms name:Rebecca image:rebecca_red me

You did a fantastic job too!

:::

::: sms name:Rebecca image:rebecca_red me

In fact, the guy I was talking to is an investor. He thinks we could potentially sell devices to test chrome contamination

A machine? We're just chemists. We can't build a machine.

:::

::: sms name:Rebecca image:rebecca_red me

We'd need to hire people for that part of the process.

Since you still need one quartile to finish I suggest we found the comapany in my name when I graduate. It's legally all a lot easier if there is just one owner. We'll balance it out later. Is that ok with you?

The investmet program requires all co-founders have a college degree before they'll invest.

How exactly will you "balance it out"? I don't think that's legally easy either. Can't we just wait 3 months till I'm also done then we'll start it up together?

The investor wants wants to start now. Says it's easier to find cheap talent near the end of a semester. I'm afaid if we give him a hard time he might back out and this once-in-a-lifetime oppertunity will pass us by.

Besides, you said you just wanted to do more research and not as much the finanacial/management aspect. 

:::

::: sms name:Dianna image:dianna_robinson

Ok, if you are so adament. Please think how you will "balance it out" when the time comes though.

Before you get to excited about the next step, don't forget to finish your part of our lab report for advanced annealing.

Did you turn in the lab report yet?

:::

::: sms name:Rebecca image:rebecca_red me

I see some sections are not yet filled in.

:::

::: sms name:Dianna image:dianna_robinson

I filled in all my sections. I know you are got some extra credits but if we fail this I'm not graduating next quartile, it will be another year.

:::

::: sms name:Dianna image:dianna_robinson

Please tell me you actually completed the lab.

:::

::: sms name:Rebecca image:rebecca_red me

Sorry Of course I did! Let me just fill it out. Deadline is at 12 right?

:::

::: sms name:Dianna image:dianna_robinson

It's 11

:::

::: sms name:Rebecca image:rebecca_red me

Yep! Ok! I got this! Don't worry.
