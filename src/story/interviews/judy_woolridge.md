**Officer:** How do you know Rebecca?

**Woolridge:** We go way back to elementary school, so we've been friends for
at least 18 years, and since I'm only 23 that's a long time.

**Officer:** It says here you come from Boxon, it's a long way away

**Woolridge:** Duncan can't drive, so he needed someone to bring him here.
Won't say no to a chance to visit the city. I'm not doing much with my
life right now so if an opportunity to help someone out comes along I'm
always happy to take it.

**Officer:** Can you recount exactly what happened today?

**Woolridge:** Well nothing really special happened, we loaded the truck, unloaded the truck, I brought the truck back to the shop,
then when I came back I found bits of wood scattered across the whole lawn and right in the middle of it the wreck
of a large closet. Nobody was around, I found Rufus and he was the one that noticed the blood.
