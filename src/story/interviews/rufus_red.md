**Officer:** How do you know Rebecca?

**Red:** She is my sister.

**Officer:** You live all the way in Boxon right? When did you arrive in Greenfield?

**Red**: We had some family stuff me and Red needed to take care of. Because of his new job Red
    was unable to come to Boxon because of his new job, so me and Yellow came here last week to arrange stuff, also to congratulate him on his new job and house.

**Officer:** Can you recount the events of this morning?

**Red:** Nothing event full really happened all morning. I arrived at Rebecca's
old flat at around 9 AM. We loaded the truck during the morning. 

**Red:** After unloading the truck onto the pavement, Around 1 PM Judy went to bring it back to the rental
place. I was assembling some shelves in the basement. I heard the sound of Judy coming back, Some time later
I walked up, there I found everyone else just standing in a circle outside, silent, not saying anything.

**Red:** I think we where all in shock. Then Duncan arrived, not from the house, IDK where he was. He spanned us out
of it and called an ambulance. We didn't have much hope.
