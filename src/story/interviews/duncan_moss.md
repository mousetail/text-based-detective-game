**Officer:** How do you know Rebecca?

**Moss:** We had been dating for 6 months

**Officer:** Can you recount what happened today?

**Moss:** Everyone was acting super odd from the start. They where all still mad at each other from last night I guess
First Judy and Rufus arrived together. Judy was sleeping on the couch in the old appartment the night before
but didn't show up Saturday night, I guess they where together.

**Moss:** We loaded the truck mostly in silence, drove to the new place. Dianna was already there. We barely unloaded the
truck before Judy drove off in it. Guess the whole situation was too uncomfortable for her too. Dianna and Rufus
seemed to purposefully avoid each other, carefully looking if the other wasn't there before coming to the entrance
and picking up stuff.

**Moss:** I realized we didn't have any soap or toilet paper yet, so I walked to the store to get some. It's just a few
minutes away. When I came back I found her. Everyone was right there not doing anything, like they didn't even care.
I called an ambulance. 

**Officer:** What happened Saturday night that made everyone so mad?

**Moss:** So emotions where tense from the very start. Which makes sense considering the grief. Seemed Rufus felt
Rebecca didn't care enough, but she just shows her emotions in a different way. Surely her brother would know that?

**Moss:** I don't know what exactly happened Saturday. We where all going to get dinner together at that indian place,
I was a bit late. I work part time on Saturdays. Something had happened. Rufus and Judy where yelling at Rebecca and Dianna. Dianna
was also yelling. Made quite a scene.

**Moss:** Judy announced she and Rufus where leaving and basically dragged him with her. Dianna also left.
Just me and Rebecca where left and we had dinner with just the
two of us.

**Moss:** Rebecca refused to tell me what it was about. She was clearly shaken though. She said she wondered if she did
the right thing but wouldn't tell me what the thing was.

**Moss:** One of them is responsible for sure. They let their emotions get the better of them.
