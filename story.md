# Transcripts

## Blue

### How did you know Red?

We started out chemistry major in the same year. We did a group project together, and worked very well together. We soon became friends, did basically every group project together the whole time until... until I was unable to continue my study.

### What is your occupation?

I'm currently in between jobs. I was studying until recently... Red though said he owed me a job at the startup he
was starting, but apperently the investment firm he is working with has some objections. He said he'd sort it out. Now though, guess I'll need to consider other options.

last week, and now Red... guess I'm the only one left to carry on the legacy.

### Where where you when Red tragically fell from the window?

I was in the basement, I was helping paint the walls. I heared a scream and ran outside. Yellow was already there, blue came running out just after me. I know he was just trying to fix the upstairs window so we all thought it was just an accident.
